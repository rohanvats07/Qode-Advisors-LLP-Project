                X ( Earlier Twitter) Stock Market Sentiment Analysis Project
Project Overview:
    This project analyzes Indian stock market discussions on Twitter/X to create trading signals using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
    Due to Twitter's API restrictions, we use a sample dataset that demonstrates the complete analysis pipeline.

Project Implemenation:
Phase 1: Data Collection (main.py)
    Original Plan: Scrape Twitter for stock market tweets
        - Target hashtags: #nifty50, #sensex, #intraday, #banknifty
        - Extract: username, timestamp, content, engagement metrics
        - Goal: 2000+ tweets from last 24 hours

    Reality: Twitter API blocks scraping attempts
        - Solution: Created AI-generated sample dataset
        - Sample maintains realistic data structure and patterns
        - Demonstrates complete analysis pipeline

Phase 2: Data Cleaning (data_cleaning.py)
    Work:
        - Cleans and normalizes tweet text
        - Handles Unicode characters (important for Indian language content)
        - Removes duplicate tweets
        - Converts timestamps to proper format
        - Standardizes username formats

    Key Features:
        - Memory-efficient processing
        - Data quality validation
        - Proper error handling
        - Saves cleaned data in CSV format

Phase 3: Signal Analysis (analysis_signal.py)
    Text-to-Signal Conversion:
        - Uses TF-IDF to convert text to numbers
        - Applies dimensionality reduction (SVD)
        - Creates engagement signals from likes/retweets
        - Combines multiple signals into trading recommendations
    
    Trading Signals Generated:
        - STRONG_BUY: High positive signal + high confidence
        - BUY: Medium positive signal + good confidence
        - HOLD: Neutral or low confidence signals
        - SELL: Medium negative signal + good confidence
        - STRONG_SELL: High negative signal + high confidence

    Visualizations:
        - Signal trends over time
        - Signal distribution charts
        - Confidence vs signal strength plots
        - Trading recommendation pie charts

Phase 4: Performance Optimization (optimized_analysis.py)
    Speed Improvements:
        - Parallel processing using multiple CPU cores
        - Chunked data processing for large datasets
        - Memory-efficient operations
        - Vectorized calculations

    Scalability Features:
        - Can handle 10x larger datasets
        - Memory monitoring and optimization
        - Automatic garbage collection
        - Performance benchmarking
