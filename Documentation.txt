                Twitter Stock Market Sentiment Analysis Project
Project Overview:
    This project analyzes Indian stock market discussions on Twitter/X to create trading signals using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
    Due to Twitter's API restrictions, we use a sample dataset that demonstrates the complete analysis pipeline.

How It Works
Phase 1: Data Collection (main.py)
Original Plan: Scrape Twitter for stock market tweets

Target hashtags: #nifty50, #sensex, #intraday, #banknifty

Extract: username, timestamp, content, engagement metrics

Goal: 2000+ tweets from last 24 hours

Reality: Twitter API blocks scraping attempts

Solution: Created AI-generated sample dataset

Sample maintains realistic data structure and patterns

Demonstrates complete analysis pipeline

Phase 2: Data Cleaning (data_cleaning.py)
What it does:

Cleans and normalizes tweet text

Handles Unicode characters (important for Indian language content)

Removes duplicate tweets

Converts timestamps to proper format

Standardizes username formats

Key Features:

Memory-efficient processing

Data quality validation

Proper error handling

Saves cleaned data in CSV format

Phase 3: Signal Analysis (analysis_signal.py)
Text-to-Signal Conversion:

Uses TF-IDF to convert text to numbers

Applies dimensionality reduction (SVD)

Creates engagement signals from likes/retweets

Combines multiple signals into trading recommendations

Trading Signals Generated:

STRONG_BUY: High positive signal + high confidence

BUY: Medium positive signal + good confidence

HOLD: Neutral or low confidence signals

SELL: Medium negative signal + good confidence

STRONG_SELL: High negative signal + high confidence

Visualizations:

Signal trends over time

Signal distribution charts

Confidence vs signal strength plots

Trading recommendation pie charts

Phase 4: Performance Optimization (optimized_analysis.py)
Speed Improvements:

Parallel processing using multiple CPU cores

Chunked data processing for large datasets

Memory-efficient operations

Vectorized calculations

Scalability Features:

Can handle 10x larger datasets

Memory monitoring and optimization

Automatic garbage collection

Performance benchmarking
